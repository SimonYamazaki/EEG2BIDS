#How to make a BIDS compliant EEG dataset

1. Make a EEG2BIDS_*YOUR-TASK*.m file 
2. Make a EEG_*YOUR-TASK*_job.sh file 
3. (If any source data or derivative data should be added to the BIDS directory) make a EEG2BIDS_*YOUR-TASK*_derivatives.m or EEG2BIDS_*YOUR-TASK*_sourcedata.m file.

Look at already existing files for the flanker-task and the MMN-task for inspiration.
