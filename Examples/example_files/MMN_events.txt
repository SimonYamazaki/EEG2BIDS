Events send from matlab		Read to EEGlab or Fieldtrip

0: start of file				65280
1: When the first sound is played		65281

There is only an event when the first tone is played.
The rest of the events should be added afterwards in the analysis of the data.

This is carried out using the file subject_MMN_triggers.mat that can be loaded into matlab
This file contains:
mmn_codes: a vector with the tones played: 1 is standard, 2 is deviant1, 3 is deviant2, 4 is deviant3
rand_ISI: a vector with the interstimulus interval (jittered between 400-600 ms)
start_samples: start_samples of each tone (with the sound sampling frequency 44100). To recalcilate this to the EEG samples: 
start_samples_EEG = round(start_samples/(44100/fs_EEG))

Note: There is a delay between the trigger and when the sound is actually played in the headphones of 37 ms, see also the file trigger_delay.
